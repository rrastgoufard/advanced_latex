 
Howdy!

This is a latex presentation that I made about
advanced concepts that I use in latex.  Most
of it revolves around automating latex using
python scripts.

The presentation itself is in the tex folder.
It has served me as a reference, so maybe
it will be useful to others as well.

In addition to the tricks in the presentation,
the file code/make_pygments.py is infinitely 
useful for me when I make any latex document that
contains source code that I need to include.
That file alone should probably be in its own
project repository.  You can consider the rest
of this repository as a way of inspiring you to
use that file.  All of the code snippets are
tagged in the source, and you can examine all of
the python and latex sources to see how the
snippets are included in the final document.

I suspect this repository will be useful for 
me in the future.  Maybe it will have value to
others as well.
